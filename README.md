# Machine-Learning-lab_03

This is my academic lab report named 'lab_3' of CCS4340-Machine Learning (3C) module.

This lab consists about how perform mean median imputation utilizing pands, Scikit-learn and Feature-engine

#Mean or Median Imputation with pandas

    use 'fillna()' method

#Mean/ Median imputation with scikit-learn

    use SimpleImputer(strategy = "median")

#Mean/ Median Imputation With Feature Engine

     MeanMedianImputer( imputation_method = "median", variables= numeric_vars)
